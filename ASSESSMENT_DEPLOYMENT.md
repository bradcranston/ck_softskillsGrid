# Assessment Interface Deployment Guide

## Overview
Successfully created a consolidated assessment interface that evaluates skills from `data.json` using the original grid interface design.

## What Was Built
1. **Modified Original Interface**: Adapted the existing skills grid to work with assessment data from `data.json`
2. **Assessment Data Integration**: The interface now displays assessment items organized by:
   - Headers (e.g., "Attendance & Punctuality", "Workplace Performance")
   - Subheaders (used as skill names)
   - Questions (used as descriptions)
   - 4-option scoring system from data.json

## Key Features
- **Original Look & Feel**: Maintains the same visual design and functionality as the original skills interface
- **Assessment Categories**: Filters for "Assessment Items" instead of skill levels
- **Scoring System**: Uses the 4-option scoring system defined in data.json
- **Single File Deployment**: All CSS and JavaScript consolidated into one HTML file for FileMaker

## Deployment
Run the following command to create and deploy the consolidated interface:

```bash
npm run deploy-to-fm
```

This command:
1. Builds a consolidated HTML file with all CSS and JavaScript inlined
2. Creates `dist/index.html` (51KB single file)
3. Uploads to FileMaker via the upload script

## File Structure
- `data.json`: Assessment structure with Headers, Subheaders, Questions, and Options
- `index.html`: Modified HTML template (displays "Assessment Item" instead of "Skill")
- `src/index.js`: Updated JavaScript logic for assessment data processing
- `scripts/build-consolidated.js`: Build script that inlines CSS and JavaScript
- `dist/index.html`: Final consolidated file for FileMaker deployment

## Technical Details
- **Function**: `window.loadTable(assessmentData, contactData, scoreData, user, date)` - Main entry point callable from FileMaker
- **Assessment Processing**: `groupAssessmentsByHeader()` organizes data by assessment categories
- **Filtering**: Modified to work with assessment types instead of skill levels
- **FileMaker Integration**: Maintains all original FileMaker script calls and data structures

## Usage in FileMaker
Load the consolidated `dist/index.html` file in a FileMaker web viewer and call:
```javascript
window.loadTable(assessmentData, contactData, scoreData, "Username", "MM/DD/YYYY");
```

The interface is now ready for production use with assessment data from your data.json file.
